  Navigating New York City public transit is a big part of life for every New Yorker - but it looks different for every person based on what neighborhood they live in. Brooklyn’s Brownsville and Ocean Hill has thousands of residents, with MTA buses and trains as the common mode of transportation - but between the two zip codes there's only one accessible subway station for people with disabilities. So what needs to, and can be changed?

    <div class="text"> Transportation timing is a different game for able-bodied people than for many people with disabilities: someone with limited mobility may have to ride several extra subway stops to reach an accessible station, but if accessible stations are scarce, then their trip is far longer. </div>

    <div class="icon">
      <img src="images/bus.png" alt="MTA bus"></div>
    <div class="text"> All NYC buses are currently wheelchair accessible, and in the next year MTA will put 800 new buses into service that have more flexible seating options. Still, buses can also face delays for any number of reasons, and aren't ideal for trips between boroughs. </div>

    <div class="text"> The existing Access-a-Ride program costs the same as the subway or bus, but users have experienced long waits through the service for years. The shared feature was suspended when COVID-19 hit, and single rides allowed for safer, more comfortable - but shared rides are back and advocates for people with disabilities are calling on the MTA to reverse policy. </div>

    <div class="icon">

    <div class="text"> And taking an Uber, Lyft or other independent ride-share service isn't a feasible option for many, either: 29.4% of the district lives below the poverty line - the 7th highest in the whole city - so residents with disabilities depend on public transportation options to get around NYC. </div>

    <div class="text">
    It's a big city and transit change happens slowly. This year, MTA completed accessibility projects at the 57 St station in Manhattan, the Gun Hill Rd station in the Bronx and, and the Manhattan-bound side of the Court Sq-23 St station in Queens. Still, signs of train upgrades in Brownsville and Ocean hill remain to be seen. </div>

    <div class="icon">

    <div class="text"> Some help is coming: a brand new three-year “DFTA My Ride” on-demand car pilot program is available to Brownsville and Ocean Hill, along with other CDs among Brooklyn, Queens & the Bronx. It includes 24/7 access to door-to-door car service, including wheelchair-accessible vehicles, for rides within the five boroughs, Nassau, and Westchester counties. The question remains: will it reach enough people in need? </div>
